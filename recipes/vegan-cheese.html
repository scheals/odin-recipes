        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Almonds and nutritional yeast blend together to replace aged Italian cheese for those who don't want to eat real cheese.</p>
        <p>The taste is so similar when used in pesto or on top of pasta, it is hard to tell the difference.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup nutritional yeast flakes</li>
            <li>¼ cup almond meal </li>
            <li>1 pinch sea salt (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine nutritional yeast, almond meal, and sea salt in a blender. Using short pulses, blend the ingredients just enough to come together.</li>
        </ol>
